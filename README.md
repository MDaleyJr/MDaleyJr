Hello, My name is Michael Daley. I am a retired MSgt with 20+ years of active duty service in the District of Columbia Air National Guard. For 14 years I was a mechanic on the F-16's enforcing the No Fly Zone over the DC area. I was then promoted to a leadership role where I spent the last 6 years as a shift lead. I was in charge of a six man team working 48 hour shifts, managing their leave, training and command and control of multiple military aircraft in a high anxiety,  high stress environment that could escalate at any given time. Now I am taking my soft skills developed and proven over the course of my old career into a new journey in cybersecurity. I am currently working with cybervets.org on learning technical skills through hands on training in real world scenarios.  As I start this new career path I know that with the hard work and dedication I bring combined with the guidance in technical skills and honing of my soft skills from cybervets.org this journey will be an exciting one.
